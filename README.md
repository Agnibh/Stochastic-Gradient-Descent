# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent

Implement and test SGD algorithm for logistic regression in two different scenarios namely, Hypercube and unit Ball.
The project starts with defining domain and parameter set for both the scenarios. 
Then we define the rho - Lipschitz and M bond over the parameter set. 
To calculate SGD model, we provide input training samples, generated randomly according to a gaussian distribution. 
Then, the model is tested on fresh samples to determine the logistic loss and binary classification error. 
Finally, we plot the graph of the expected excess risk and expected classification error with respect to number of input training samples.
Furthermore, we show the standard deviation of these estimates on the plots.
